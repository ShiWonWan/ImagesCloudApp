# Image Cloud App

## Work description
I made a complete app to store your photos in the cloud, with login.

## Technologies and explanation
- Python Flask & SQLAlchemy 

I used the Flask for the HTTP requests, and SQLAlchemy for the managment with MySQL


## Functionality
The use is very simple, anyone can enter and register on the site, when you login you can enter to upload your photos, download the ones you have already uploaded, and delete them if you wish.
